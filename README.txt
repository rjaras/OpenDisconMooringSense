Run cmake here to configure the source to be shared with CL-Windcon partners.

In the build directory generated by cmake (which is called whatever you
called it when you ran cmake), you'll have 2 things:

  1 - the sln (vstudio) or makefile (gnu) to build the static ikWitcon library
  2 - a directory called ikDiscon. CL-Windcon partners will have to run cmake
      on a copy of that to get the sln or makefile to build the shared library
	  with the DISCON function. You can provide them this generated ikDiscon
	  directory plus the static library you built with (1). Note that you'll
	  have to build them a different static library depending on their target.
